Hi Steve,

here are the fixes and additions I made to my QB64 SDL copy so far, I've
reformatted both, your and my libqbx.cpp to be able to use WinMerge.

I've also added the .bak files of your original files (which I've taken
directly from your GitHub), so you can make a quick check of my changes,
hopefully I didn't mess up anything.

Changes in qb64.bas:
--------------------
>> added support for full path specification in DECLARE LIBRARY
   - interestingly it was already implemented for the Linux version,
     but not for Windows
>> added my code for array_check() handling, so that it is waived to
   whenever $CHECKING:OFF is in effect
   
Changes in libqbx.cpp:
----------------------
>> fix for the unreliable string compare routines
   - these I've simply replaced with the correct functions from the v1.2
     (probably still the same in v1.3)
>> addition for &B prefix in INPUT(#), DATA and VAL
>> fixed the cmd lines for SHELL calls (added 0-termination)
   - this was discussed at qb64.net back in 2010-2012??, it could lead to
     failure of the SHELL call, or random data (mostly an console error)
     was written into internal\c in a file which its name was actually
     the command which was SHELLed out
   - this happend, as a basic string was used instead of a c-string,
     AFAIK its replaced by c-strings in the current GL versions
>> fix for the _MEMIMAGE/_COPYIMAGE/_FREEIMAGE memory lock issue
   - see BUGS board at qb64.org
