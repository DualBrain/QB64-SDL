The QB64 compiler/IDE is freeware, meaning it can be copied/distributed freely but the compiler/IDE have an implicit copyright belonging to the author. It uses SDL (Simple Direct-media Library(http://www.libsdl.org/) which is licensed under LGPL (GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).

The DLL (dynamically linked libraries) files associated with SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/license-lgpl.php) are LGPL. When distributing QB64 programs in executable form created with this version of QB64 you must:
1) Include a copy of "lgpl-2.1.txt" (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt) and
2) Prominently acknowledge that your program uses SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/) and state that SDL is licensed under LPGL.
All SDL libraries are used in their 'standard'/unmodified form and source code for these libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

You (the QB64 user) are under no obligation to release the source code to the programs you create. You can sell the programs you create for profit. Although you must acknowledge SDL you do not need to include any acknowledgement related to QB64 when distributing your programs.

In Windows distributions, the QB64 compiler calls MinGW64 executables downloaded from http://www.drangon.org/mingw/ (Specifically version: "mingw-w32-bin-i686-20120109.7z : native mingw-w32 (i686) toolchain under Windows XP/2003 i686, build from SVN 2012-01-09 (25M)") to generate compile C++ code into executable (.EXE) form. A full copy of MinGW64 is included with this distribution of QB64. Its sub-folders are present in the 'qb64/internal/c' folder. As MinGW64 extends MinGW the licensing requirements are as follows (http://www.mingw.org/license):
